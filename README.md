# farhan-aziz Portfolio Website Version 1.0

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This site showcases my projects, skills, and experiences as a software developer. The design is not really that fancy, but it does the work.

##Overview

This website is built using Angular for dynamic and responsive user interfaces, combined with basic CSS to create a clean and professional design. The site is fully responsive and aims to provide an engaging experience for visitors on both desktop and mobile devices.
